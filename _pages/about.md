## Short Bio ##
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at San Antonio ([UTSA](https://www.utsa.edu/)). I have worked under the supervision of [Professor Ravi Sandhu](https://profsandhu.com/) and [Professor Ram Krishnan](https://ceid.utsa.edu/rkrishnan/) and was affiliated with the Department of [Computer Science](https://cs.utsa.edu/) and the [Institute for Cyber Security (ICS)](https://ics.utsa.edu/). Before that, I received my master's and bachelor's degrees from the Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University (MBSTU), Bangladesh. I worked in multiple R&D organizations for several years before starting my Ph.D. training. As part of my Ph.D. dissertation, I have solved various cybersecurity problems leveraging AI and data science advancements. My research has been published at prominent security conferences such as ESORICS, CODASPY, etc. In addition, I served as a program committee member and reviewer for different workshops, conferences, and journals. I am an active member of ACM and IEEE.
