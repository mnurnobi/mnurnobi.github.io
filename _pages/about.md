My research's main direction falls under the umbrella of AI for Security and Security for AI. I plan to utilize data analytics, AI, and Machine Learning (ML) to develop automated tools for effective, accurate, and secured cybersecurity solutions.}
Due to the vast number and sophistication of malicious activities, private and public networks and organizations have struggled to secure their computer systems and networks\footnote{https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BUDGET-2020-PER/pdf/BUDGET-2020-PER-5-8.pdf}. Numerous cyber attacks and malicious activity incidents from internal and external threats are reported every year. Keeping a system unprotected and failing to recover promptly could cost the world trillions of dollars annually\footnote{
https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/}. Many incidents, such as data theft and system compromises, occur due to improper protection methods. Many of these systems are manually managed. Such issues could further exacerbate and bring additional challenges with the proliferation of cloud-based applications that perform machine-to-machine access through APIs, Internet of Things (IoT), Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), etc. The below sections outline my overall research plan.
